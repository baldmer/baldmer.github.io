Finally, the day had come, our Division contest took place last Sat. 18. I had the opportunity to be in a contest with the best communicators in our Division.

My speech was titled "The Power of a Red Nose", it was mainly about my experience as a Clown Doctor. Even though I missed a few strong parts and I felt that I didn't give the best I have, I won the second place. I can't believe I was sharing the stage with the most talented and experienced communicators of the Division.

I am satisfied with my performance because I accepted the challenge for the third time, with three different speeches. I have learnt a lot from this experience, I know that there is still much to learn, but I am getting better and next year I will be more experienced, stronger and wiser.

Congratulations to the contestants and the people in the audience, we all are winners.

Thank you to the ones who made this fantastic journey possible.


#### The speech


*There are people in hospitals, having a terrible time, suffering, fighting dead..., imagine how beautiful it is when you go and brighten their lives with a smile.*

*Madam contest chair, fellows Toastmasters and welcome guests.*

*When was the last time you smiled at a stranger?,  honestly I don't do it very often like many people, because of the insecurity it is considered dangerous. But here, we are in a friendly environment, you can take the chance to smile to the person next to you. For that ...,  I'M GOING TO INVOKE THE GREATEST OF MY POWERS, to draw a smile on your faces, I'm going to use this red nose. (wear the red nose)*

*Some people says that a smile is highly contagious, so I want to see an outburst of smiles. Smiling has many benefits, it helps you release stress, anxiety, nervousness, right now I'm not nervous because I'm smiling, no, actually, I'm TERRIFIED!,  but when you smile you feel happy, you feel better and it is good for your health, therefore, you will live longer. So, after this speech I'm going to add MILLIONS OF NANOSECONDS OF LIFE TO YOUR LIVES. Believe what I say because it is a scientific fact and because I'm an Engineer, an amateur Scientist and a special kind of Clown.*

*I used to go to hospitals to brighten the life of people, dressing like a doctor and wearing this red nose. The very first time I entered a hospital, I approached a room, very quietly, I opened the door (inside was a little child lying on his bed, he looked like a 'cabbage patch doll', very cute), I only had to wave my hand and smile. When the noticed my presence IMMEDIATELY he drew a smile on his little face. I didn't have to say any joke, nor any word and he smiled to life..., CAN YOU IMAGINE THE EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF THIS RED NOSE?. (remove the red nose) It is just a simple object made of plastic, but I would say that it is made of magic.*

*Most of you are healthy or at least you are not in a hospital room. You take life too seriously, you are always thinking about your problems, your goals, your qualifications, your job, money..., which it is fine, because those are part of life, but sometimes you must STOP for a moment, disconnect your brain from the world, leave your problems behind, be like a child, open your heart and smile to the beauty of life.*

*Madam contest chair.*
