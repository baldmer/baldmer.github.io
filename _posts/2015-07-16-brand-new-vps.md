I have been migrating my blog to a new virtual private server (VPS), I have decided to opt for a VPS because my former web hosting provider was quite expensive and they offered a lot of resources that I never used.

The fist step was to find a reliable and affordable VPS provider, there are thousands of providers out there and is well known that a VPS is more expensive than a web hosting plan. I started my quest for my VPS and I found a company that offer a classic VPS with 1 vCore, 1 GB RAM, 10 GB HD, Anti-DDoS, unlimited reboot and installation, Debian 8 available for installation, KPI and backup once a week; only for 2.99 dlls per month (monthly payment). My first thought was: 'this is not real, it is scam', but it was real, I contacted the company, I placed my order, after they verified my identity I made the payment and my VPS was ready.

Maybe the bad side of having a VPS, is that you have to build everything from scratch, for some people this process can be frustrating because is not that easy like having a cpanel and with a few clicks here and there everything is working nicely. I have no problem with that, many years ago I had a VPS and I used to enjoy playing around with it. In a few minutes I had a LAMP server ready to install my wordpress blog, I only had a minor problem with DNS records, this VPS provider currently do not offer primary DNS only secondary DNS. I spent a few days looking for a domain registrar that provides DNS support, I found namecheap, I just had to transfer my domain to this new registrar and they allowed me to use their DNS.

At the moment the server seems to fit my needs, compared with my other hosting provider, the difference is dramatically noticeable.
