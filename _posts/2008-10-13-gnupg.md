This is the simplest way to compile and install GnuPG.

```
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.9.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf gnupg-1.4.9.tar.gz
$ cd gnupg-1.4.9/

$ ./configure

Version info:   gnupg 1.4.9
Configured for: GNU/Linux (i686-pc-linux-gnu)

Please select what kind of key you want:
(1) DSA and Elgamal (default)
(2) DSA (sign only)
(5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
ELG-E keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 1024
Requested keysize is 1024 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire
<n>   = key expires in n days
<n>w = key expires in n weeks
<n>m = key expires in n months
<n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
“Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>“

Real name: Baldomero Valdez Valenzuela
Email address: my_email_address
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
“Baldomero Valdez Valenzuela my_email_address”

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

GnuPG with FireGPG extension

FireGPG Is a Firefox extension under MPL to encrypt, decrypt, sign or verify the signature of text in any web page using GnuPG. This extension allows you to use GPG’s features in your Gmail. If you encrypt a message in your system an send it via email to someone, the person who receive the email need to have your public key in order to decrypt the message.
