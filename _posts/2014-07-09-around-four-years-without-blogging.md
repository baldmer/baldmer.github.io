During these years I have been working hard. I joined the DM team in September of 2009. There is a lot of material to post, but I have been immersed into the routine. Fortunately I have been using my skills, such as Linux, SQL with MySQL and Object Oriented Programming with PHP. Also I am learning a new set of skills, such as designing databases, good coding practices, designing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), among others.  

It is time to say "Hello World!" again.
