title: Competent Communicator Award (CC)
tags: [Others]
---

Recently I completed my Competent Communicator (CC) manual at Toastmasters, it took me five years (with a few breaks). I can not believe how this program has changed the life of many people, I am glad for being one of those many.

It is not easy to speak before of people when you are a shy person and it is even more difficult when you have to speak in your second or third language. I have discovered that the key to conquer anything is practice and of course, not being afraid to fail. I remember that I started my journey in a humorous speech contest, it was one of my first sessions in my club Delta Toastmasters, I was terrified to dead, very nervous, but I decided to feel the experience and participate, I did not meet the time requirement to be eligible, so I was disqualified.

Even though I already had a CC in my mother tongue, I decided to start all over again in a second language. Here is the list of ten speeches I had to complete, some of them were awarded during International speech contests.

Thank you to my club Delta for the valuable feedback on every project and for making this award possible.

P. S.

There are no gifted people, only people who try with the best they have to reach a goal.
