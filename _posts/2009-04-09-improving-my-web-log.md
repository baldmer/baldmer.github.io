#### What's new in my web log?

Recently I finished my new web log design, I have implemented some fancy things with JQuery, adding some CSS and adapted some code in the CMS I'm using. Best of all, my entire web log now has valid XHTML.

And also, I've migrated my web log to another VPS(Virtual Private Server) sponsored by a friend of mine. In later posts I tell you about how funny was the VPS configuration.

#### What's the future of my web log?

Well, I still don't know about the future, but some people has made great suggestions about its content. They say that I should post more things about me, not just IT stuff, lol !.

That's it for now, feel free to let me know if you have suggestions, comments, bugs reports on this design or whatever you want.
