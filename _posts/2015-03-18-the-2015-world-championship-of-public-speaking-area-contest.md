Last March 14th we celebrated our Area 01 contest to select the best speaker who will represent the Area in the Division contest.

My speech was titled 'Duke', it was a sad story about my first best friend, my dog Duke. Honesty, that speech had everything to win, it was filled with joy, drama, sadness and a message for the audience, I almost cried on the stage. The judges liked my speech and they chose me to represent the Area in the upcoming Division contest. All the contestants did it very well, they have outstanding speaking skills.

It was a great experience for learning and improving, now I know that when I want to get something, I just need to try the best I have to get it, dreams can become reality.
