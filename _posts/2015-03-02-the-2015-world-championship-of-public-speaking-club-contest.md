It is time to find the 2015 world champion of public speaking, all this fantastic journey starts at club level.

Last Saturday I participated in one of my clubs with the speech titled: "My Comfort Zone".  I always strive not to memorize the whole text, because I can not trust my memory, so I only prepared an introduction, a body with several main points and a conclusion, anything else is pure magic coming from somewhere in the Universe.

Here is how my script looked like:

#### Opening statement

Comfort is your greatest enemy, start fighting it.  (I said something like: Comfort is your friend, but do not trust it. I started a little nervous).

#### Introduction

Speak about all the comfort I have at the moment and the important things I lack.

#### Body

Break the silence, WAKE UP!
Motivate them to reach their goals, their dreams, what their really want in life.
If you always wanted to study in the best Universities in the world.
If you want a better job or being your own boss.
If you want a healthy life style.
If you want to find the love of your dreams (Joking, I do not know how to get that).
YOU CAN DO IT!.
You have the power to succeed, just CHALLENGE YOURSELF, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, start failing.

#### Conclusion

You can have everything you ever wanted.
Tell to yourself: I can do it, I will do it and I will never give up.

Madam Toastmaster.

I agree that writing the whole speech makes you sharpen the details. I will try to write it down and post it here. Meanwhile I must prepare for the area contest, (yes!, I won the first place).

Thank you fellows for this fantastic experience and the feedback.
